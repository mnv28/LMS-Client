            the valid and subsisting licenses, permits and consents required for
            the conduct and operation of its business from appropriate competent
            authorities and shall comply with all applicable laws and
            regulations at all times.
            <br /> ii. You understand that the Company may facilitate fee
            financing options to Users from its Lending Facilitators, to enable
            such Users to meet their fee obligations with the institute. You

            such financing can be conveniently accessed/ used.
            <br /> iii. To avail the financing, the Lending Facilitators may
            seek your ‘know your customer' ("KYC") documents/ information. The

            financing only for purposes permitted by the Lending Facilitator(s)
            and in accordance with applicable laws. ix. For any repayment
            towards the financing or other applicable charges, you have
            authorised the Lending Facilitator and/or any of their service
            providers to collect such amounts from you as may be due to them
            from time to time and take all steps necessary to collect such
            payments. x. An institute shall, upon cancellation (of any reason)
            of the Services to the customer availing financing options through
            the Teachpay Service, immediately inform the Company of such refund

            or disclose such confidential information to any third-party. xiii.
            The corresponding institutes shall be solely responsible and liable
            for any claim, demands, conflicts, disputes arising between the
            User/customer and the institute. The Lending Facilitators shall not
            be made a party to any such claim which is strictly between the User
            and the institute. xiv. Notwithstanding any other provisions
            contained herein, in no event shall any of the Lending Facilitators
            be liable to you for any direct, indirect, consequential, or similar
            damages of any kind whatsoever.
